# Completed Tasks

[x] we need to make sure each job allows for uploading image/video/audio/audiorecord
[x] we need a way for people to create and fund jobs. 
[x] jobs should show funded when they are funded and by how much
[x] when a user clicks on a audio translation it should use their language. if translation does not exsist it should use their language fallback. then if not that then the final fallback. 
[x] audio translation popup is to fast. we need it to stay up 30 seconds
[x] we need to be able to mark how many responses we want to a job. default is one. this is like if someone wants 20 people to do the same voice or the same picture set. 
[x] setup the default jobs to auto load into the system.
[X] create a job should have have a place to upload audio/image/video/and audio record like completing jobs does since the user might barely read or write. 
[X] a user should only be able to complete jobs that have not been completed
[x] a user should only be able to complete a job once. 
[X] making a job should allow recording video then just like finishing jobs does
[X] the defualt Quechua Voice Recording job should start as funded
[X] search jobs on brows job page starts with None in the box
[x] browse jobs should just show funded jobs with an optional check box to show unfunded.
[x] Show unfunded jobs check box needs proper formating
[x] add browse job page checkboxes for completed jobs, unfunded jobs, defualt selected should only be funded jobs
[x] i have a funded ob but its not showing on the brows job page. we should be able to see it
[X] when i am in a funded job i see no way to click to sumbit page?
[X] when a user makes a job it should have an amount per person that completes it. defualt is one person so in that case they need to fund 1xamount. but if they want more then one person then it should b n*amount and that should be the amount requested for funding.
[x] Idioma del audio should not be there for the one doing the job. when a job is created it should be created for a specific language. that language should be displayed.
[X] Deliverable Types * (comma-separated: text,video,audio,image) should be multi select
[X] Fund this job immediately - removed. we should create the job and will create a wallet. and then the user will fund it.
[X] Deliverable Types * spacing has been limited
[X] we need to have a dashboard that only shows if there are jobs we made. if we made a job it should show a list of the jobs. and its current state if completed or not. if a job is completeded we should have place we see/download files then mark complete. this should also show partial completions so we can release partial funds.
[X] once a user has completed a job that job should stop accepting new posts. and should have that as a status. waiting completion.
[X] finishing a job should also live recording of a video with audio or to take a picture right there rather then just upload. we want to keep upload though. Easy part done (camera capture for video/images), hard part (MediaRecorder API) documented in TODO-Hard.md
[x] ok we need to change the flow of things. funded is no longer a thing. jobs should be drafts, awaiting sellers/submiter profiles, waiting confirmation/selections of submiters, waiting for submissions, waiting for confirmation of submisions, expired, complete. 
[x] make a submitting limit say 10 defualt and a time frame. so if either hits it swiches to review and submissions are not allowed anymore.
[x] we need to add a new work flow. so when a user creates a job. then workers can submit their profile. the job maker needs to see all the workers and select those they want to do. then there needs to be a button (doesnt work yet) that will send them to make the pre approved payment for those people. then when users upload the work. they need to be able mark the work as complete.
[x] jobs should have a expired date. if nothing is reqruited in the time or if its in submitting if no submissions by then it swiches to expired. created wallet contract should expire 7 days after this date.
[x] we need to search for places where funding is mentioned. that does not match the new flow. the new flow is they make a job. then it goes up for reqruiting. then the poster can view and select who will have the job. at the end the click "create contract" button that will take them to the pre approve payment page. or click close for submissions and it goes to selecting. selecting can be skipped if they just click create contract then it goes to submitting. at any time they can close for sumbisions then it goes to reviewing. they can review basics of submissions and hit complete. if complete the state changes and the contract payment is released.
[x] make a reqruite limit so when that limit is hit it changes to selecting. also add a time that it will auto change default to 7 days. should be an option in job creation.
[x] on job creation give a way to save it as a draft. make the drafts discoverable in one of dashboard were job creaters can see their jobs
[x] seprate signup pages for job creaters and job doers
[x] make creaters and doers only see links to things relevent to themselves
[x] add a profile page where users can update their profile
[x] add a demo users list where the json 
[x] make it so the defualt jobs are in diffrent job states from the docs/job-states file. we dont need expired. just the usefull states. 
[x] all the stuff in apply should exsist in profile and auto fill from profile
[x] browser jobs dashboard should show how many have been submited of workers or if in works submit stage it should show how many of needed have been submited. it should also have some tags. applied would be good. or about to start when its like 48 hours or less be for deadline
[x] lots of things missing spanish translation. can we get that added to the forms and such. 
[x] anyplace we have titles we want to start having the speaker button so we can read out the thing in the native langauge selected
