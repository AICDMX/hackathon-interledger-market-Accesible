[] we need to make sure each job allows for uploading image/video/audio/audiorecord

[] we need a way for people to create and fund jobs.

[] when a user clicks on a audio translation it should use their langague. if translation does not exsist it should use their language fallback. then if not that then the final fallback. 
[] audio translation popup is to fast. we need it to stay up 30 seconds
[] we need to be able to mark how many responses we want. default is one. this is like if someone wants 20 people to do the same voice or the same picture set. 
[] setup the default jobs to auto load into the system.
