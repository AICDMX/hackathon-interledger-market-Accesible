#Todo file
## instructions
Pick any job not in progress or done only those empty []
Before doing anything. Immediately claim it. claim a job check box with a [P] for in progress.
mark [C] for user to check the work and wait.
[X] when it is done.

if wallet work is needed make sure to add it todo-wallet.md cause the wallet part is not implimented. so we just leave buttons and add a task there. 
you can break things up into more tasks in this file. but only do one task at a time. so first mark it p for in progress then create a new job with [] but dont do it. just stop at the part your doing and leave that for later. 

## jobs
[X] we need to add a new work flow. so when a user creates a job. then workers can submit their profile. the job maker needs to see all the workers and select those they want to do. then there needs to be a button (doesnt work yet) that will send them to make the pre approved payment for those people. then when users upload the work. they need to be able mark the work as complete.
[C] we need to search for places where funding is mentioned. that does not match the new flow. the new flow is they make a job. then it goes up for reqruiting. then the poster can view and select who will have the job. at the end the click "create contract" button that will take them to the pre approve payment page. or click close for submissions and it goes to selecting. selecting can be skipped if they just click create contract then it goes to submitting. at any time they can close for sumbisions then it goes to reviewing. they can review basics of submissions and hit complete. if complete the state changes and the contract payment is released. 
[P] make a reqruite limit so when that limit is hit it changes to selecting. also add a time that it will auto change default to 7 days. should be an option in job creation. 
[X] jobs should have a expired date. if nothing is reqruited in the time or if its in submitting if no submissions by then it swiches to expired. created wallet contract should expire 7 days after this date. 
[P] on job creation give a way to save it as a draft. make the drafts discoverable in one of dashboard were job creaters can see their jobs
[C] seprate signup pages for job creaters and job doers
[C] make creaters and doers only see links to things relevent to themselves
