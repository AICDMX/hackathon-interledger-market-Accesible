## instructions
Pick any job not in progress or done only those empty []
Before doing anything. Immediately claim it. claim a job check box with a [P] for in progress.
mark [C] for user to check the work and wait.
[X] when it is done.

if wallet work is needed make sure to add it todo-wallet.md cause the wallet part is not implimented. so we just leave buttons and add a task there. 
you can break things up into more tasks in this file. but only do one task at a time. so first mark it p for in progress then create a new job with [] but dont do it. just stop at the part your doing and leave that for later. 

## jobs

[C] anyplace we have titles we want to start having the speaker button so we can read out the thing in the native langauge selected, Información del Perfil i dont see one and a ton of other places this task will take a few passes. think all titles. and icons that are clickable. includeing menu items and all the form fields everywhere. like Idioma Preferido. remember the buttons especially, and Seleccionar idioma 
  - First pass completed: Created form_label_with_audio.html component, updated profile page (all form fields and buttons), language selector, apply_to_job page. Still need to update remaining templates (dashboard, create_job, edit_job, submit_job, job_list, etc.)
