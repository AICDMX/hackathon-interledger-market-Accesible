#Todo file
## instructions
Pick any job not in progress or done only those empty []
Before doing anything. Immediately claim it. claim a job check box with a [P] for in progress.
mark [C] for user to check the work and wait.
[X] when it is done.
if no jobs then just stop and let the user know

if wallet work is needed make sure to add it todo-wallet.md cause the wallet part is not implimented. so we just leave buttons and add a task there. 
you can break things up into more tasks in this file. but only do one task at a time. so first mark it p for in progress then create a new job with [] but dont do it. just stop at the part your doing and leave that for later.
