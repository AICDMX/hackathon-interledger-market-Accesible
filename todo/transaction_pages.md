# Transaction Pages (Nice to Have - Future Enhancement)

**Note:** Escrow and payment functionality is moved to "nice to have" to focus on a minimal accessible marketplace first. These pages can be implemented later when adding payment/escrow features.

## Escrow System (Future)
- [ ] Escrow status page showing:
  - Active escrows
  - Pending releases
  - Completed transactions
- [ ] Escrow detail page for each transaction
- [ ] Escrow creation flow (when job is posted)
- [ ] Escrow release page (when submission is accepted)
- [ ] Escrow refund page (when submission is rejected)

## Payment Pages (Future)
- [ ] Payment initiation page (when posting a job)
- [ ] Payment confirmation page
- [ ] Payment history page
- [ ] Payout page (for creators receiving payments)
- [ ] Transaction detail page showing:
  - Amount
  - Status
  - Timestamps
  - Related job/submission

## Interledger Integration (Future)
- [ ] Interledger test connector setup page
- [ ] ILP payment flow integration
- [ ] Payment status tracking
- [ ] Error handling for failed transactions
- [ ] Transaction reconciliation page

## Financial Dashboard (Future)
- [ ] Total ILP payouts display
- [ ] Funded work tally
- [ ] Earnings summary (for creators)
- [ ] Spending summary (for funders)

## Current Minimal Approach
For the minimal marketplace, we're focusing on:
- Job posting with budget display (no payment processing)
- Submission workflow (accept/reject)
- Basic user profiles
- Accessibility-first design
